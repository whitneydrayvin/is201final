        <h3>Have you ever wanted to take you car from bone stock, base model, to a head turning machine?</h3>
        <p class="p">Well it's really not that hard! It only takes a few hundred thousand dollars, hours of labor, and an undying desire to make your day to day activities way less convenient.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Here is how you get it done:</h4>
        <br>
        <div class="list">
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Collect funds</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start a DIY company with the focus of bodywork. This is best accomplished by aquiring a hammer, bondo, and as many flat head screwdrivers as possible. This will give the you the necessary skills to start your own project</li>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <li>Short sell all of your friends and family members. Think of anyone you know between the ages of 14-18; this group is especially susceptible to the enticings of a modified car. They are also young, which means that they don't really care what the end product looks like.</li>
                    <li>Lastly, make sure that with every modification you do, add your Instagram handle to each piece. This will insure the growth of your company.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                <li>Find time</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>As I said, this process will take many more hours than you could possibly have to spend. It will also put a strain on every aspect of your life. But it's all worth it.</li>

                    <br>
                    <li>Cut out un-necassary things like a third meal, time with your wife and kids, that pesky Saturday shift, even the golf trip with your grandpa.</li>
                    <li>Eventually your heart will soothe and you will be able to find the joy in your car, rather than the things you used to hold most dear :)</li>

                <br>
                <br>
                <li>Live with inconvenience</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prepare yourself to hate every single task that brings you out of the house. Every bump in the road will become your biggest fear. Even a small pebble could mean the difference between having a leaking oilpan on the way home or not.</li>

                    <li>Maybe you will take a quick trip to the mall? Not if theres a parking lot involved.</li>
